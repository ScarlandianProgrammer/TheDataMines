- Pull Requests should only resolve one issue. There can be exceptions, but try to limit your branch.
- Every pull request should include "Closes #Issue-Number", so that the branch auto-closes when pulled.
- Branch names should be in the following format: Name-IssueNumber-Title. ex. ScarlandianProgrammer-#827-ImprovingSprites
- There should be no curse words in any commits, branches, issues, pull requests or comments.
